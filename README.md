# Learn Python the Quick Way

This repository contains example code of the book _[Learn Python the Quick Way](https://codefun.tech/learn-python-the-quick-way/)_.

## About the Book
This introductory book is designed to help those who have never programmed before start using Python quickly. The points selected in this book are well thought out and carefully chosen to be essential to master as a beginner.
The emphasis in this book is on understanding the basic concepts of programming, which will give you a solid foundation for understanding the advanced concepts of programming in the future; after all, the advanced concepts are built on top of the basic concepts.
This book adopts a combination of theory and practice. We will gradually implement an “Employee Management System” in learning. By the end of the book, we will have a fully functional command-line version of this system.

## Who This Book Is For
Any reader who wants to start programming with Python. Specifically, it is suitable for readers in the following categories:
1. No experience with other programming languages and a desire to get started quickly;
2. Someone who just learned Python from other sources recently, but some of the concepts still seem confusing;
3. Having programming experience in other languages but want to give Python a try; if you have enough experience, you can even read this book in a day to start your Python programming journey;
4. Someone unsure about learning the programming but willing to try it out.
In short, this book covers what a Python beginner should know while being short enough to learn quickly.

## Why Python
Compared with other programming languages, Python has three main advantages:
1. The most important point for beginners is the simplicity and ease of learning;
2. Having a big community, you can get help easily;
3. Super practical. Python is not a toy or ivory tower language. It is a language you can use immediately, whether it’s for data analysis, web crawling, building servers, or writing practical scripts.

## How the Book Is Organized
As mentioned earlier, the points in this book have been carefully selected for beginners, and they are the building blocks for constructing advanced programming concepts. You should read this book chapter by chapter.
Chapter 1 introduces what programming is and how to write your first Python program using the Thonny IDE.
Chapter 2 introduces **variables** and three basic types: Numeric, String, and Boolean.
Chapter 3 introduces four essential **data structures**: list, tuple, dictionary, and set.
Chapter 4 introduces **control structures**: conditional structure and loop structure, specifically, `if` statement, `match` statement, `while` statement, and `for` statement.
Chapter 5 introduces **functions** and concepts of parameters, arguments, return value, and scopes.
Chapter 6 introduces **classes** and **objects**, which are the cornerstones on which the Python is built.
Chapter 7 introduces **modules** and **packages**. One of the major reasons for Python’s popularity is the large number of built-in and third-party modules and packages, which together form a large community.
Chapter 8 introduces how to read from or write to files, which often store data our program needs.
Chapter 9 implements a command-line program, which is an “Employee Management System.”
